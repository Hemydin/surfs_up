## Surfs_Up

#### Project Overview:
Using Python and SQLAlchemy, I ran some analytics on temperature data for June and December in Oahu to support the investment decision of opening the surf and ice cream shop. 

#### Results
Comparison of June and December data to describe summer and winter temperatures across a seven-year period (2010 - 2017):

* The average temperatures in June and December were 75°F and  71°F.
* June had a low temperature of 64°F, and a high of 85°F, whereas December had a low of 56°F and high of 83°F.
* The standard deviations in June and December are 3.26 and 3.75, respectively, which indicate that weather data in both months dispersed relatively close to the mean.

#### Summary:
In addition to the precipitation and station analysis completed earlier in Module 9, this additional temperature analysis enhances the business proposal to open up Oahu's surf & ice cream shop.
